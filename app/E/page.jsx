        text={`The digital world has grown very rapidly in recent years and has taken a very important place in people's lives. People are in the digital world in their homes, schools, workplaces and in all daily areas. Digitalization makes people's lives easier, but one of the most important problems is how does the digital world affect people's lives?
Digitalization provides many conveniences in people's lives. However, we should not forget the disadvantages as well as these conveniences. For example, today, students prefer to take notes quickly from the computer instead of taking notes analogously. However, this convenience also has disadvantages. According to studies conducted at universities in the UK, students who actively listen to the lecture and take analogue notes have a higher attention level than students who use computers. It is recommended for students with distraction to get away from the digital world and follow the learning tactics in analogy. Another example is young people who prefer to read digital books instead of regular books. According to the latest research, the rate of young people reading digital books has increased by 120% in the last ten years. How much should this method of reading be preferred when there are so many distracting factors in the digital world? The answer to this question is still not fully answered. Of course, it is not possible to stay away from digitalization today, but the recommendation by scientists is to find the balance between digital and analog. For this balance, it is to use the virtual world at certain times of the day, but to prefer the analog method while taking notes,studying,working and etc. If this balance is created, both the work life for the employees and the education life for the students will be more productive.
In conclusion, with all its positive and negative aspects, digital technology has now become an irreversible fact of our lives. The two most important things we can do in the face of this situation are to help the development of digitalization, because the digital world makes people's work easier in many areas. The other is to find solutions to the negative effects of this development.
